    "### 3. Quality Control\n",
    "\n",
    "After we load and explore our dataset, the next step is to perform some quality control (QC) so that we have a clean dataset prior to statistical analysis. In a GWAS, there are quite a few quality control measures we have to do. For this tutorial, we will focus on just a few QC measures. In order to organize ourselves, let's split these quality control measures into two categories: QC on the sample data and QC on the variant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with QC on the sample (phenotype) data:\n",
    "1. Remove individuals with high levels of missingness (people who we do not have enough data for)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue on to QC on the variant (genotype) data:\n",
    "1. Remove variants with low minor allele frequency (MAF)\n",
    "2. Remove variants that deviate from Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hail has a few QC methods that can help us get started. These methods, **sample_qc** and **variant_qc**, extract quality-related information from our MatrixTable and store them into variables that we can later reference. While we are at it, let's also create another variable (filtered_mt) that will hold the filtered version of our MatrixTable after QC.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want more information on QC on GWAS data, including definition and best practices of the above QC terms, please check out the following paper by [Marees et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6001694/)"
